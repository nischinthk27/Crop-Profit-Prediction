## 🌾 Agricultural Profit Predictor
A machine learning-powered web application that helps farmers predict crop yields, prices, and profitability based on historical data and agricultural parameters.A pure Python Machine Learning module that predicts crop yield, price, and calculates expected profit for farmers.

#📊 Features
Yield Prediction: ML model trained on enriched agricultural data (53% R² accuracy)- Crop Yield Prediction: Random Forest model predicts yield per acre based on historical data

Price Forecasting: Predict crop prices based on historical trends (97% R² accuracy)- Price Forecasting: Predicts crop prices with year-based trends (6% annual increase)

Profit Analysis: Calculate expected revenue, costs, ROI, and profit per acre- Profit Calculator: Calculates net profit using the formula:

User-Friendly Interface: Modern, responsive web design with animations ```

Farmer-Centric Inputs: Simple inputs based on previous year's data Profit = (Yield × Price × Area) - (Cost × Area)


Technologies Used- Farmer-Friendly Units: Uses acres and quintals (standard Indian units)
10+ Crops Supported: Paddy, Wheat, Maize, Cotton, Sugarcane, and more

Backend: Flask (Python web framework)- Year-Based Predictions: Accounts for inflation and market trends

Machine Learning: scikit-learn (RandomForestRegressor)

Data Processing: pandas, numpy## 📈 Model Performance

Model Persistence: joblib

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript- Yield Model Accuracy: 78.4% R² Score

Price Model Accuracy: 94.5% R² Score

## Usage

## 💰 Calculation Formula

1. Select your crop season and type

2. Choose your district```python

3. Enter the year and area to be cultivatedPredicted Yield (quintals/acre) = ML Model(Season, Crop, District, Year, Area, Production)

4. Provide previous year's production, area, and total costPredicted Price (₹/quintal) = ML Model(Crop, Year) × Year Adjustment Factor

5. Click "Predict Profit" to get instant predictionsTotal Revenue = Yield × Price × Area

Total Cost = Cost per Acre × Area

## ContributingNet Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost

ROI = (Profit / Total Cost) × 100
